About
--------
This original hud was made by raysfire, currently maintained by CriticalFlaw. mysthud is a custom game ui modification for Team Fortress 2, it combines a few elements from multiple other huds but using rayshud as its core.

I like rayshud, which is why I am NOT going to edit most of its contents. mysthud are my edits of rayshud with changes such as edits to certain elements that I find very 'off', or can be improved to my liking.

My edit of rayshud was published because there were requests for it.

Contrasts
----
The biggest and most obvious difference in this edit is changing the main theme of the hud from cyan to white. I am not a big fan of rayshud's cyan color. Another major change is making most hud elements white in color, rather than using the default TF2's dull white color.

This gives the hud a cleaner look as compared to rayshud.

Updates
----
You can expect this hud to be updated regularly for as long as I am playing Team Fortress 2. The updates will be merged over from rayshud as soon as they get updated.
